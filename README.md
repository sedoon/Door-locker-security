# Door-locker-security
## Based on two ATmega32 microcontrollers,
the first microcontroller is connected with the "human_interface (ECU)" to interface with the user, and the second microcontroller is controls and saves and gives instructions to other components. 
The first ECU is connected to LCD and Keypad for the user to give it his instructions, second ECU is connected to the DC motor for opening and closing the door, 
and External EEPROM to save the password. 
### Drivers designed the project: Timer, UART, I2C, External EEPROM, Keypad, LCD, and DC Motor
These pictures in below will show how to design the drivers layers and   the hardware connection :
